This website is powered by [Hugo] (http://gohugo.io), a static site generator written in Go by [Steve Francia](http://spf13.com/).

Having maintained several wordpress blogs over the years, I sought a more minimalist and efficient approach for this blog. After considerable research, I chose Hugo (over Jekyll) for its speed and simplicity. With Hugo, you write content using markdown and run a program to generate HTML pages. It includes an embedded webserver to serve the content locally. Changes are reflected automatically, thus enabling one to iterate quickly.

A combination of [Atom](https://atom.io/) to develop the content, Hugo to generate static pages and Amazon S3 to serve the content keeps things dead simple.

Take a look at the [Quick start guide](http://gohugo.io/overview/quickstart/) if you're curious to learn more about Hugo.
